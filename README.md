Welcome to this repository showcasing my proficiency in SQL ðŸ‘‹ â€”an amalgamation of solo projects and practical applications during my exploration of SQL, machine learning, and other data analytics courses. Within these digital corridors, you'll encounter an array of meticulously crafted SQL queries and scripts. These exemplify my adeptness in database management, ranging from data cleansing and intricate queries to the implementation of strategies for database optimization. Each script is meticulously documented, offering a transparent insight into the methodology and reasoning underpinning the design of the queries. Furthermore, I've woven in insights from diverse data analytics courses, illustrating the symbiotic relationship between SQL and machine learning. Whether your interest lies in database management, data analysis, or the fusion of SQL with machine learning techniques, this repository serves as a curated collection that encapsulates my skill set and projects in the realm of SQL.
